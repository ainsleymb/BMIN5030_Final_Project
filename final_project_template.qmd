Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers. Feel free to change the theme and other display settings, although this is not required.

## Overview {#sec-overview}

The goal of my project is to analyze disparities in patients with gestational diabetes. Specifically, I will create a model to predict whether a patient with gestational diabetes will be ordered inpatient insulin during delivery. Receiving inpatient insulin at delivery for gestational diabetes patients is an indicator of more sever gestational diabetes, so this model will help me uncover factors related to severe gestational diabetes.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Gestational diabetes affects \*\*\* patients annually and is associated with adverse birth outcomes including larger babies and babies experiencing low blood sugar after birth. Women with gestational diabetes are also more at risk for developing Type 2 diabetes in the future.

Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem. This should extend what is in the @sec-overview.

Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

## Methods {#sec-methods}

Describe the data used and general methodological approach used to address the problem described in the @sec-introduction. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.

## Results {#sec-results}

Describe your results and include relevant tables, plots, and code/comments used to obtain them. You may refer to the @sec-methods as needed. End with a brief conclusion of your findings related to the question you set out to address. You can include references if you'd like, but this is not required.

## Conclusion

This the conclusion. The @sec-results can be invoked here.
